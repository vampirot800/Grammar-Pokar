Pokar Syntaxis Grammar

This grammar directly mirrors the syntax used in playing poker, providing a structured representation of the game's elements. It defines the values of individual cards, the various combinations that players can achieve, and the composition of hands. By capturing the specific language used in poker gameplay, the grammar facilitates the understanding and parsing of poker-related sentences.  

The grammar presented can be classified as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) within the Chomsky Hierarchy Extended Level. Context-Free Grammars are characterized by rules that define how symbols (both terminals and non-terminals) can be combined to form strings. In this grammar, the rules define the syntactic structure of poker-related sentences, including plays, combinations, hands, and individual cards.
